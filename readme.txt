== Description ==
TapChat is the ultimate platform to connect your website visitors with on demand video chat and standard chat. Unlike any other chat or “Call-Me” platform, TapChat is a lightweight plugin that can be embedded on any page of your site. Visitors, with a click of a button can be connected with you via our free IOS and Android App or Web Admin Section. 

A TapChat subscription is required starting at 39.00 per month for up to 2000 minutes of video calling. Think of TapChat as chat on steroids! 

A visitor clicks the TapChat icon on your site and instantly you are notified of an incoming TapChat request. On the app, you can accept or reject the call. A complete record of all incoming calls are recorded so you can easily reach back out to any missed or declined calls as well as respond with follow ups to those you had previous calls with. 

Increase conversions, sales and build connections and establish trusted relationships with your visitors. 

Now you can tell your customers to “TapChat Me” exclusively available at https://tapchat.me
